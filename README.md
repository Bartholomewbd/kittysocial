A basic create-react-app implementation. 

I modified the app Robofriends that iscreated in the Zero to Mastery course.

I changed the cards  to display cats instead of robots and added the city object to the cards.  

In the course a basic search is created to search the cards by name.  I extended this search to include city and email.
